This is a project based on the game: WORDLE. The user gets six chances to guess a 5 letter word, and after each guess they get feedback: Either their letters are correct, incorrect, or correct but in the wrong place.

This project uses a words file (words.txt) that needs to be downloaded and put in the same folder as the executable file of the code. It uses this file to pick a random word which it then asks the user to guess. It also uses this file to check whether the word that the user has entered is a correct English word or not. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the 5 letter word, or when he runs out of guesses.
